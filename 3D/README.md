# 3D printed parts

For the Atomization to control the humidity a water bottle is used as a storage. I had some issues to get the Atomization work without clogging the module with water.
I cut a sponge to fit into the bottom of the BottleDispenser and put the DispenserTop piece on top of it. You need to remove the silicon part of the atomizer and put it on top of it.
Still experimenting with it, but it works most of the time. I plan to have the atomization ultrasonic module to clip into the top part.

I put a coat of spray paint over the BottleDispenser to make it waterproof.
